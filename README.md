# Plant-Point-Cloud

Here is a portion of the point cloud dataset we have collected, which we hope will contribute to research in the field of plant phenotyping. These data are derived from our work titled "Delving into the Potential of Deep Learning Algorithms for Point Cloud Segmentation at Organ Level in Plant Phenotyping." If you use these data, please include a citation.
